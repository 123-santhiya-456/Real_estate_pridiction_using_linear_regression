# Linear Regression – Real Estate Price Prediction

## Description
This project uses Linear Regression to predict real estate prices based on property size. It demonstrates a complete regression workflow including data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict the price of a property using its size. By learning the linear relationship between property size and price, the model can estimate prices for new properties.

## Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression (Supervised Learning – Regression)

## Dataset
Real Estate Price Dataset  
Columns:
- size – Property size (independent variable)
- price – Property price (target variable)

## Steps Involved
1. Load the dataset  
2. Split features and target  
3. Perform train-test split  
4. Train Linear Regression model  
5. Evaluate using MAE, MSE, and R² score  
6. Visualize regression line  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
